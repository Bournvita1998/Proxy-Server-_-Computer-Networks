-> The Proxy Server has been implemented in python language.

-> All the cached files are stored in a folder named Cache which is automatically created when the proxy server is run.

-> To start the proxy server write the commmand "python proxy.py <port_number>" .

-> The proxy server is started at localhost and port number inputted.

-> The main server is running at localhost and port 20000

-> Use the proxy server using curl command "curl -x http://localhost:<port_number> ​ http://127.0.0.1:20000/<file_name>"

-> The data of the file is outputted on terminal.

-> Attached screenshot is of two cases where once file requested is in the server and other case where file does not
   exist in the server. The responses and corresponding states have been shown.

-> Featres Implemented :
      - Error handling is done.
      - Caching is implemented.
      - No more than 3 files/responses can be cached.
      - If a new file is requested and the cache is full then the oldest file is removed from cache.
      - If a file is modified then file gets updated in cache too.
      - Multiple requests can be handled to the proxy server.
      - Threading is implemented.
